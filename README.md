## ToDo Rails API

This project is Grape API mounted on Rails.

You can check working example on [Heroku](http://todorailsapi.herokuapp.com/doc/api)

Login as:
```
- user: test@test.pl pass: test1234
or
- user: fake@test.pl pass: test1234
```
and feel free to add, edit, delete tasks and lists through swagger-ui.

In this example I use devise to authenticate user. To auth you should put obtained token in header input. Data is stored in MongoDB. API is written in Grape framework and documentation is generated by swagger-ui.
## Run

If you want to run this application you have to install MongoDB and create new database (you can change name in config/monogid.yml).

```
bundle install
rake db:seed
rails s puma
and open
http://localhost:3000/doc/api
```

If you want to deploy this on Heroku you need to run rake assets:precompile and commit generated files.
