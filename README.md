## ToDo Rails API

This project is Grape API mounted on Rails.

You can check working example on [Heroku](http://todorailsapi.herokuapp.com/doc/api)

Login as:
```
- user: test@test.pl pass: test1234
or
- user: fake@test.pl pass: test1234
```
and feel free to add, edit, delete tasks and lists through swagger-ui.

In this example I use devise to authenticate user. To auht you should put obtained token in header input. Data is stored in MongoDB. API is written in Grape framework and documentation is generated by swagger-ui.
