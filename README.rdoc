ToDo Rails API
============

This project is Grape API mounted on Rails.

You can check this on
http://todorailsapi.herokuapp.com/doc/api

Login as:
- user: test@test.pl pass: test1234
- user: fake@test.pl pass: test1234

In this example I use devise to authenticate user. Data is stored in MongoDB. API is written in Grape framework and documentation is generated by swagger-ui.
